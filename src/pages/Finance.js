          Inflation is either monetary (including debt service and loitering
          before either foreclosure or amortization), marginal (unemployment),
          or a non-deflationary nor equalizing time-to-outcome job (investment).

          How can we be having a structural labor shortage if we have had a
          lower employment rate historically? Isn't the historical minimum rate
          of employment always marginally deflationary while any more real
          income than NAIRU unemployment is true inflation?

          Is a strong labor market one that increases the total benefit per
          outcome? Isn't a strong labor market marginally deflationary?
